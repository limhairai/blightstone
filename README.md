## Testing

### E2E Testing (Playwright)
E2E tests are set up but currently disabled for production launch. To enable:

1. Update environment variables in `.env.test`
2. Add `data-testid` attributes to components for reliable selectors
3. Run: `npx playwright test`

**Current Status**: Authentication setup works, logout flow needs component selector refinement.
